# sort_my

A simple Python script that organizes files by type and creation date.  
It groups known formats (like images, videos, and documents) and moves unknown ones to a `lost_files` folder — all safely under user permissions.

## Output

```bash
📊 --- Sort Report ---
📁 Path sorted: /Users/example/Downloads
🗂️  Total files sorted: 18
📦  Total files moved: 18
🪄  Folders created: sort_my_pictures, sort_my_documents, lost_files
```
